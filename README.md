# One Man's Journey to Deleting Code for Fun and Profit
The repository contains examples used in my tech talk. This is my clean code talk which introduces you to the three S's and the organic growth of your code using these techniques which help you discover duplication and the ability to delete code in order to add functionality to your code base.

The slides for the presentation are located on my [google drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-fVNT-stUi4GY5QlYfpFRf9cQ2_g2tdRDW7dsXAT8YM/edit?usp=sharing)
